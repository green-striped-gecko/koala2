South Coast Koala Monitoring II (Comparing 3 different RBG-sat methods)

A)	Compare estimates of occupancy rates following the method developed in the previous report (Gruber et al. 2021: Trends in Koala occupancy ion the South Coast of NSW) using three different approaches
i.	Method I: Original RBG-SAT method (analysed as in the previous report)
ii.	Method II: Censored (filter existing data by stopping once the first pellet was found).
iii.	Method III: Rapid-Sat: (filter trees by agreed tree list and then use only those trees. Stop once the first pellet was found.
B)	Estimate and compare accuracy (bias and precision) of the three methods
C)	Simulate different scenarios (to be developed, e.g. a 10% decrease and also the actual increase from the original data ~5%) and the ability to detect the simulated trend
D)	Give an evaluation based on the previous findings which method might be most useful to monitor trends in koala occupancy.
